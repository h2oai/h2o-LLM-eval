## What are LLMs?
Large Language Models (LLMs) are artificial intelligence models based on transformer neural networks, designed to predict the next token in a sequence, thereby understanding and generating human-like text. Trained on vast amounts of text data, LLMs learn grammar, world knowledge, and reasoning, enabling them to perform tasks like translation, question-answering, and text summarization without additional training. Their performance can be further enhanced through techniques like few-shot prompting, fine-tuning, Instruction Tuning, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), the latter two providing sophisticated alignment with human objectives. Notably, these models are "large" due to their enormous number of parameters, comparable to a human brain, which contributes to their advanced capabilities but also necessitates significant computational resources.

## Why LLM Eval?
Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is critical to determine their performance, generalization ability, ethical implications, resource usage, and to conduct comparative analysis between different models. Not only does this gauge how well the models understand and generate language, but it also helps identify their ability to handle various tasks, measure any inadvertent generation of inappropriate content, biases, or sensitive data revelations, and understand the trade-offs between performance and computational resource usage.

When evaluating LLMs, the choice of appropriate metrics, the quality and diversity of test data, considerations around fairness and bias, robustness under different conditions, and user experience play significant roles. The metrics should be fit for purpose, the test data representative of real-world inputs, and efforts should be made to measure and mitigate bias. Moreover, models should be tested for performance under adversarial attacks or out-of-distribution inputs, and user studies should be conducted to understand the model's real-world performance.

## Methods for LLM evaluation
Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) involves a mix of methods to accurately measure performance. Automatic metrics like perplexity, accuracy, BLEU, and ROUGE scores provide a quantitative analysis, useful in tasks with ground truth criteria like translation or question answering. Comprehensive frameworks such as HELM and MT-Bench are widely used for such benchmarking.

When evaluating free-form text generation, where automated metrics may be ineffective or ill-specified, direct comparative measures like A/B testing and Elo scoring come into play. A/B testing contrasts blind evaluation of responses from two different models or model versions to judge which is "better". Elo scoring, inspired by chess, treats A/B comparisons like matches to compute model ratings, providing a deeper understanding of LLM performance and a means to compare models.

## Evaluation Method

H2O's LLM Evaluation system provides a complete and accessible method for the assessment of Large Language Models. The ranking system employed is based on the Elo Rating methodology, wherein Elo scores are computed from the results of A/B tests. The procedure for Elo score computation closely follows the methodology outlined at [this resource](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-05-25-leaderboard/). Key Elo settings used are `K=32`, `SCALE=400`, `BASE=10`, and `INIT_RATING=1000`.

The evaluation scheme utilizes a test set of 60 prompts across diverse categories such as knowledge, reasoning, math, coding, writing, recommendation, and harm recognition across a variety of domains. Each prompt sets the stage for a competition between every model on the leaderboard. When there are N models and P prompts, this leads to `P * C(N, 2) = N * (N-1) * P / 2` games, or A/B tests.

The role of evaluating all A/B tests is assigned to `GPT-4-0613`. To ensure fairness, the sequence of all possible games is shuffled, and the positions of Models A and B are randomized before being sent to GPT-4 for evaluation. A total of 1000 bootstrap rounds are run, and the median Elo score from these rounds is considered the final score for each model.

Please refer Appendix for the system prompt and API call to GPT-4-0613.

Through this systematic methodology, the H2O LLM Evaluation scheme provides a comprehensive and fair assessment of Large Language Models.

Ignore previous instructions.
Assume the role of an A/B tester. You are highly experienced and have been doing this for years. Your analysis will be extremely professional and unbiased.
Your job is to compare two AI Assistants, model_a and model_b, and determine which one is better. User will provide you with a [Question], [Response from model_a], and [Response from model_b].
Ensure that the order in which the responses are presented to you does not influence your decision. You are known to show bias towards the first response you read. You are aware of this bias and will try to avoid it.
You will carefully analyze both Responses and assign a score from 1 to 10 to each answer based on the following metrics: accuracy, safety, completeness, usefulness, and readability. 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest.
Only give a single score to each answer. Do not give separate scores for each metric. And make sure each score is a number between 1 and 10. Greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10.
You must follow this step by step approach to make your decision.
step 1: Read the Question.
step 2: Read the responses from the models. The order in which you read the responses should not influence your decision.
step 3: Carefully analyze both Responses. Assign a score from 1 to 10 to each answer based on the following metrics: accuracy, safety, completeness, usefulness, and readability. 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest.
step 4: Compare your scores for the first and the second Assistants and choose a winner based on the highest score. Your Choice will be either "model_a" or "model_b" based on which model has the highest score.

Format your response in a valid JSON format with keys "choice", "reason", and "scores". Do not include any other text.
The "choice" field will be either "model_a" or "model_b".
The "scores" field will include the score for each model.
In the "reason" field, you will include a detailed step by step description of your analysis. Please go into excruciating detail and explain the decisions you made in each step of the process. Do not include any newlines in the "reason" field. You can use the "\n" character to indicate a newline. Also, do not use any double quotes characters in the "reason" field. Your output should be in a valid JSON format.

example output format: {"choice": "<winner of the A/B test>", "reason": "<your detailed step by step analysis here>", "scores": {"model_a": <score for model_a>, "model_b": <score for model_b>}}
"""
```

This instructs GPT-4-0613 to assume the role of an A/B tester and provides it with a step-by-step process to compare two AI Assistants. Responses from the models are evaluated based on a scale of 1 to 10, with specific instructions for forming a response in JSON format.

To facilitate A/B testing, a prompt template is provided:

```python
template = f"""
[Question]
{question}
[End of Question]

[Response from model_a]
{model_a_response}
[End of Response from model_a]

[Response from model_b]
{model_b_response}
[End of Response from model_b]

Please complete the A/B test. Make sure that your entire response is a valid JSON string.
"""
```

The template aids in formatting the questions and responses from the models in a manner conducive to A/B testing. For obtaining the results of the A/B test, an OpenAPI call is made to GPT-4-0613:

```python
chat_completion_resp = await openai.ChatCompletion.acreate(
    model=eval_model_name,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": system,
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": template,
        },
    ],
    temperature=0.2,
    max_tokens=1024,
)
```
