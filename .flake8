# You probably noticed the peculiar default line length.
# Black defaults to 88 characters per line, which happens to be 10% over 80.
# This number was found to produce significantly shorter files than sticking
# with 80 (the most popular), or even 79 (used by the standard library).
# In general, 90-ish seems like the wise choice.
