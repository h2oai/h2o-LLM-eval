    "# Evaluating All Models Using GPT-4 as an A/B Tester\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook contains code to evaluate all A/B tests across all prompts for a benchmark. The code reads in a list of unevaluated AB tests with prompts and responses from a database, runs parallel A/B tests with GPT-4 as a judge, and writes the results back to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "Before running the code, make sure to install the necessary dependencies by setting up the Poetry environment. You will also need to set up a database connection by filling in the appropriate values in the cells below. You will also need to provide up an OpenAI API key and organization ID (if appropriate).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, specify the benchmark and evaluating model to use for evaluation. The benchmark is the name of the benchmark to evaluate. The evaluating model is the name of the model to use as a judge for the A/B tests. The evaluating model must be a model that is already in the database."
